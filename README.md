# Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting bike rental demand using machine learning algorithms. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, consists of historical bike rental data including weather conditions, time, and other relevant factors. By leveraging this dataset, I aim to develop a model that accurately forecasts the number of bikes required in a given time period, allowing bike-sharing companies to optimize their inventory and meet customer demand effectively. The predictions were uploaded on kaggle to compete in the bike sharing demand competition.



To meet specifications, the project will require at least these files:
* Jupyter notebook with code run to completion
* HTML export of the jupyter notebbook
* Markdown or PDF file of the report



### Dependencies

```
Python 3.7
MXNet 1.8
Pandas >= 1.2.4
AutoGluon 0.2.0 
```

### Installation
For this project, it is highly recommended to use Sagemaker Studio from the course provided AWS workspace. This will simplify much of the installation needed to get started.

For local development, you will need to setup a jupyter lab instance.
* Follow the [jupyter install](https://jupyter.org/install.html) link for best practices to install and start a jupyter lab instance.
* If you have a python virtual environment already installed you can just `pip` install it.
```
pip install jupyterlab
```
* There are also docker containers containing jupyter lab from [Jupyter Docker Stacks](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
